> Amazingly short non-sequential url-friendly unique id generator.








ShortId creates amazingly short non-sequential url-friendly unique ids.  Perfect for url shorteners, MongoDB and Reddis ids, and any other id users might see.

 * By default 7-14 url-friendly characters: `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_-`
 * Non-sequential so they are not predictable.
 * Supports `cluster` (automatically), custom seeds, custom alphabet.
 * Can generate any number of ids without duplicates, even millions per day.
 * Perfect for games, especially if you are concerned about cheating so you don't want an easily guessable id.
 * Apps can be restarted any number of times without any chance of repeating an id.
 * Popular replacement for Mongo ID/Mongoose ID.
 * Works in Node, io.js, and web browsers.
 * Includes [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) tests.



### Usage

```js
var shortid = require('shortid');

console.log(shortid.generate());
//PPBqWA9
```

Mongoose Unique Id
```js
_id: {
    type: String,
    unique: true,
    'default': shortid.generate
},
```



### Browser Compatibility

The best way to use `shortid` in the browser is via [browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).

These tools will automatically only include the files necessary for browser compatibility.

All tests will run in the browser as well:

```bash
## build the bundle, then open Mocha in a browser to see the tests run.
$ grunt build open
```

#### Real World Examples

`shortId` was created for Node Knockout 2011 winner for Most Fun [Doodle Or Die](http://doodleordie.com).
Millions of doodles have been saved with `shortId` filenames. Every log message gets a `shortId` to make it easy
for us to look up later.

Here are some other projects that use shortId:

* [bevy](https://npmjs.org/package/bevy) - A simple server to manage multiple Node services.
* [capre](https://npmjs.org/package/capre) - Cross-Server Data Replication.
* [cordova-build](https://www.npmjs.org/package/cordova-build) - an alternative to phonegap build that runs on your servers/agents.
* [couchdb-tools](https://www.npmjs.org/package/couchdb-tools) - A library of handy functions for use when working with CouchDB documents.
* [CleverStack/clever-email](https://github.com/CleverStack/clever-email) - E-mail system for CleverStack.
* [CloudTypes](https://github.com/ticup/CloudTypes) - JavaScript end2end implementation of the Cloud Types model for Eventual Consistency programming.
* [dnode-tarantula](https://github.com/jutaz/dnode-tarantula) - an asynchronous rpc and event system for node.js based on dnode-protocol and TCP sockets.
* [mongoose-url-shortener](https://www.npmjs.org/package/mongoose-url-shortener) - A simple URL Shortening library for NodeJS using Promises/A+ results.
* [mozilla/smokejumper](https://github.com/mozilla/smokejumper) - The Smoke Jumper project is an effort to bring dead simple, secure, P2P file sharing to Firefox.

### API

`var shortid = require('shortid');`

---------------------------------------

#### `shortid.generate()`

__Returns__ `string` non-sequential unique id.

__Example__

```js
users.insert({
    _id: shortid.generate()
    name: ...
    email: ...
    });
```

---------------------------------------

#### `characters(string)`

__Default:__ `'23456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ'`

__Returns__ new alphabet as a `string`

__Recommendation:__ If you don't like _ or -, you can to set new characters to use.

__Optional__

Change the characters used.

You must provide a string of all 32 unique characters. Order is not important.

The default characters provided were selected because they are url safe.

__Example__

```js
// any 32 unicode characters work, but I wouldn't recommend this.
shortid.characters('ⒶⒷⒸⒹⒺⒻⒼⒽⒿⓀⓁⓂⓃⓅⓆⓇⓈⓉⓊⓋⓌⓍⓎⓏ②③④⑤⑥⑦⑧⑨');
```


---------------------------------------

#### `isValid(id)`

__Returns__ `boolean`

Check to see if an id is a valid `shortid`. Note: This only means the id _could_ have been generated by `shortid`, it doesn't guarantee it.

__Example__

```js
shortid.isValid('43XTDBE');
// true
```

```js
shortid.isValid('i have spaces');
// false
```

---------------------------------------

#### `shortid.worker(integer)`

__Default:__ `process.env.NODE_UNIQUE_ID || 0`

__Recommendation:__ You typically won't want to change this.

__Optional__

If you are running multiple server processes then you should make sure every one has a unique `worker` id. Should be an integer between 0 and 16.
If you do not do this there is very little chance of two servers generating the same id, but it is theatrically possible
if both are generated in the exact same second and are generating the same number of ids that second and a half-dozen random numbers are all exactly the same.

__Example__

```js
shortId.seed(1000);
```

---------------------------------------

#### `shortid.seed(float)`

__Default:__ `1`

__Recommendation:__ You typically won't want to change this.

__Optional__

Choose a unique value that will seed the random number generator so users won't be able to figure out the pattern of the unique ids. Call it just once in your application before using `shortId` and always use the same value in your application.

Most developers won't need to use this, it's mainly for testing ShortId.

If you are worried about users somehow decrypting the id then use it as a secret value for increased encryption.

__Example__

```js
shortId.seed(1000);
```
